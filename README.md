# Drawing

This simple image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint, is aiming at the GNOME
desktop.

PNG, JPEG and BMP files are supported.

Besides GNOME, the app is well integrated in traditional-looking desktops, as
well as [elementaryOS](./docs/screenshots/0.8/elementary_labels.png).

It should also be compatible with the *Pinephone* and *Librem 5*
[smartphones](./docs/screenshots/1.0/librem_menu.png).

With flatpak however, the settings are stored in a key-value file, which can be
found (and edited) at `~/.var/app/com.github.maoschanz.drawing/config/glib-2.0/settings/keyfile`.
