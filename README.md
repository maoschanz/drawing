# Drawing

## A simple drawing application for Linux.

This application is a basic image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint, but aiming
at the GNOME desktop.

PNG, JPEG and BMP files are supported.

Besides GNOME, some more traditional design layouts are available too, as well
as an [elementaryOS layout](./docs/screenshots/elementary.png). It should also
be compatible with [Purism's Librem 5 phone](./docs/screenshots/librem_options.png).
