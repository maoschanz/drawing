  <title>Preferences</title>

  <p>The preferences dialog is splitted into 3 parts.</p>

  <section id="image">
    <title>Image</title>

    <p>You can choose the size and color of the default canvas used when
    creating a new file.</p>

    <p>When a file is saved to the JPEG or the BMP file format, the transparency
    can't be kept. The application can replace the transparent pixels with
    something else: it can be white, black, or a checkboard of greys.</p>
    <p>The option "default color" corresponds to the initial color of the
    canvas, which is usually the "default color" setting available in the
    previous section.</p>
    <p>If the replacement you want depends on the image, it's also possible to
    open a dialog every time you save an image to one of these file formats: the
    choices available in that dialog will also be white, black, or a checkboard
    of greys.</p>

    <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
           src="figures/screenshot_prefs_images.png" />

    <p>You can also set how you want to zoom on the image: explanations about
    this setting can be found in <link xref="zoom_preview#configuration">this
    page about zooming</link>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tools">
    <title>Tools</title>

    <subsection>
      <title>Appearance</title>
      <p>You can set whether you prefer normal icons (16 pixels) or large icons
      (24 pixels).</p>

      <p>Choosing if you want to display the names of the tools next to their
      icons is possible here, but the <link xref="main_features#main-menu">
      primary menu</link> of the window already provides this option. You can
      also press <key>F9</key>.</p>
    </subsection>

    <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
           src="figures/screenshot_prefs_tools.png" />

    <subsection>
      <title>Additional tools</title>
      <p>Among the available tools, a few are optional. You can uncheck the
      tools you don't need, or check the tools you need: the changes will be
      applied in the next window you open.</p>

      <note style="tip">
        <p>If a tool isn't activated by default, it's because it might be less
        reliable or useful than the enabled ones.</p>

        <p>For example, the <gui style="menuitem">Paint</gui> bucket (which
        paints an area of contiguous pixels of the same color into a new color),
        and the <gui style="menuitem">Color selection</gui> (which creates a
        <link xref="tools_selection">selection</link> from an area of same
        color), rely on code whose behavior is sometimes unexpected: it might
        follow the edges of the area but paint the wrong side of them, and at
        worst it can even get stuck if the edges are too hard to follow, thus
        crashing before being able to paint!</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the <gui style="menuitem">Brush</gui> works fine,
        but it has performance issues: if you press "undo" after having used the
        brush a few times, it'll freeze for a second. If you enable this tool,
        it's advised to save your image regularly to avoid problems.</p>

        <p>The <gui style="menuitem">Color picker</gui> tool, which picks a color
        from the pixel you click, is disabled because it's a little redundant with
        the color picker from <link xref="tools_classic_colors">the color edition
        menu</link>. The one from the color edition menu can pick an RGB color
        from any pixel of the display, while the tool is limited to pixels from
        the image but the colors it picks have a transparency channel (RGBA).</p>

        <p>The <gui style="menuitem">Highlighter</gui> is a little redundant too,
        since you can do the same with the pencil and <link xref="tools_classic_colors">
        the adequate color application mode</link>.</p>

        <p>The tool named "<gui style="menuitem">Points</gui>" works fine but
        it's designed for a pretty specific captioning purpose that may not be
        useful to everyone.</p>
      </note>

      <p>See <link xref="tools_classic">this page about tools</link> for more
      information.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Colors</title>
      <p>The <link xref="tools_classic_colors">color selection menu</link> is a
      color palette by default, but you can optionally use the full RGBA color
      editor as the default way to pick a color instead.</p>
    </subsection>

  <section>
    <title>Window</title>

    <p>Here you can set the size of the thumbnail preview, but using a bigger
    preview is not recommended for technical reasons.</p>

    <p>You can also set the color of the background "behind" the canvas.</p>

    <p>The "theme variant" option can force the app to use the dark variant of
    your current GTK theme.</p>

    <p>Finally, it's possible to choose the layout of the user interface: the
    "Compact" layout, designed for the GNOME desktop, is well tested. Other
    options include the "elementary OS" layout, designed for the elementary OS
    desktop, and the traditional layout, for MATE or Cinnamon desktop.</p>

    <note style="tip">
      <p>In this context,"symbolic icons" means that the icons are monochrome
      (black if you use a light theme, or white if you use a dark theme).
      Otherwise they can be colorful (depending on your theme).</p>
