  <title>What's new?</title>
  <p>The most recent versions are listed first.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Version 1.0.0</title>

    <subsection>
      <title>Performance</title>
      <p>
        This new version improves rendering performance, which is visible when
        editing large images with a poor CPU.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still not perfect, but it's better!
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Keyboard controls</title>
      <p>
        You can select tools with keyboard accelerators (Alt+letter). This may
        not work yet with languages using a non-latin alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressing "ctrl" will display the cursor coordinates in a tooltip. If
        you do it while using a tool, it may display additional data, for
        example the dimensions of the shape you're drawing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressing "shift", or "alt" when using a tool enables specific options,
        such as locking the direction for the "line" tool, or changing the
        filling style of a shape.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New tool!</title>
      <p>
        You can now use the new "skew" tool, to tilt an image from a rectangle
        to a parallelogram. Such a deformation can be applied horizontally or
        vertically.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New options!</title>
      <p>
        Using the "scale" tool, you may optionally set the new size as a
        relative percentage rather than an absolute value in pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to a new option, the highlighter will draw straighter, less messy
        lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pixel rendering is now very sharp when the image is very zoomed in, and
        the pencil is more precise, so you can draw each pixel precisely.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Translations</title>
      <p>
        The version 1.0.0 also features new updates to many translations, such
        as czech, croatian, german, hebrew, and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The help manual you're reading is now mostly translated in spanish,
        russian, and turkish.
      </p>
      <p>
        A huge "thank you" to contributors all around the world!
      </p>
    </subsection>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.5</title>

    <p>
      Changing the view's position within the thumbnail preview now dynamically
      and immediately updates the view, instead of only reacting to your the
      click release.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text tool gains an option to use a thicker outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the thumbnail preview and the blending mode selection have become
      more reliable and efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version 0.8.5 also features new translations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.4</title>

    <p>
      Version 0.8.4 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
      translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoing several operations one after another should be less slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not possible anymore to reload the picture from the disk if it has
      never been saved on the disk to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text tool gains an option to disable anti-aliasing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.3</title>

    <p>
      After rotating the selection, it had an incorrectly big height, but
      now it's fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outline of the <link xref="tools_selection">free selection</link> is
      now visible even when the image is very zoomed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In specific configurations, opening a file would open a second tab with an
      empty image. This weird behaviour should have disappeared.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.2</title>

    <p>
      The boundaries of the canvas are now always visibly delimited, to better
      render the area where you can draw, even if the canvas is transparent. It
      also helps to see what parts of the selection may disappear when you will
      unselect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <link xref="tools_transform">Transform tools</link> can now draw a preview
      of the pixels they may create outside of the current canvas, which makes
      the 'crop', 'scale', and 'rotate' tools more intuitive to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The straight line tool has a new option to lock its angle, so you can
      draw perfect horizontal, vertical, or 45° strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The `--edit-clipboard` command line option now works better with Wayland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scaling an image using the numerical inputs now preserves the original
      proportions of the image (unless the "never keep proportions" option
      is enabled).
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the app is compatible with older GNOME versions
      (Ubuntu LTS 18.04).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.1</title>

    <p>
      You can now crop or expand the canvas to an "automatic" size based on the
      current selection size, using new actions available in the selection
      menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bug, where the "crop" tool could erase the image under certain
      conditions, has been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preferences window, there is now an option to select if you
      prefer the dark theme variant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several minor options have been added to the tools:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><p>
        The orientation of the calligraphic nib (<gui style="button">Brush</gui>
        tool);
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Various ways to censor an information using filters, with a far quicker
        workflow, as an option of the <gui style="button">Eraser</gui> tool;
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        An "outline" option to the <gui style="button">Pencil</gui>,
        <gui style="button">Line</gui> and <gui style="button">Curve</gui>
        tools, to get better contrast, or just a cool effect around your lines.
      </p></item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.0</title>

    <p>
      The <link xref="fullscreen">fullscreen mode</link> has been completely
      redesigned to provide an easier yet less intrusive access to the tools and
      their options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The help manual has been splitted in smaller pages to be easier to read,
      and several buttons to access it have been added across the application.
    </p>

    <subsection>
      <title>New tools</title>
      <p>
        You can now use a tablet and a stylus to <link xref="tools_classic#brushes">
        draw with pressure-sensitive brushes</link>, available under the new
        optional 'brush' tool: a simple brush, an airbrush, a hairy brush, and a
        calligraphic nib.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New options for existing tools</title>
      <list>
        <item><p>
          The <link xref="tools_selection">selection tools</link> have a new,
          more rich, more readable bottom pane.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          <link xref="tools_transform#filters">Filters</link> have been
          rewritten to be more reliable, and a new filter to harmoniously
          increase contrast has been added.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          When you move or delete the selection, now the pixels left behind can
          optionally be a specific color, rather than always transparency.
          This specific color can be excluded from the selection. That feature
          is complex to explain with words, try it yourself you'll see.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The eraser tool now as options: it can use a specific color, rather
          than always transparency. This option has the same value as the
          selection replacement color mentioned above. This tool also have a new
          icon, based on the Adwaita theme.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          Options such as the text background type, the shape filling style, or
          the aforementioned eraser/selection replacement color, are now
          persisted when closing the application.
        </p></item>
      </list>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Color modes</title>
      <p>
        The user interface for selecting the <link xref="tools_classic_colors">
        active color application mode</link> has been redesigned to better show
        the accurate label, and better organize the possible modes as submenus.
      </p>
      <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
             src="figures/screenshot_color_palette.png" />
      <p>
        The "blur" mode has been removed, which simplifies the situation and
        allows <link xref="tools_classic">several tools</link> ("shapes" and
        "brushes") to get support for the color application modes in general.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Bugs fixed</title>
      <p>
        Coordinates of the selection were lost when unselecting a selection
        defined by an undo.
      </p>
